There are 3 scopes in golang:
1) Block
2) Package
3) Universe

**We can have same package spread across diff files as long as the corncerned files have
the same package name.

**To import a variable across packages the naming should start with capital letter.

** Also general practice is to have files belonging to same package under the same folder.

**Specifying the import path for import custom packages:
host/usrororganization/project/(dirs)/package
