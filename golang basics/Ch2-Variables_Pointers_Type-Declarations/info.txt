There are 4 types of declaration in go:
1) Variable
2) Type
3) Constant
4) Function

Defining variables in golang: 
syntax:- var name type = [value]

//NOTE: While declaring either type or value can be missing but not both
//for not instantiating the variable, there's a concept called zero value which handles that
For Example-

var integer int
var integer = 8
var integer int = 8
// All are valid statements

Declaring multiple variables together in one line:-
var integer1, integer2 = 2, 23
var integer, string = 2, "helloworld"

Short Declaration:-
We make use of ':=' for short declaration making use of only name and expression
For Example:-
syntax: name := expression

integer := 8
string := "aakarsh"
